# CS - 433 : ML Project 1 
## Detecting the Higgs Boson by analyzing proton collisions
This is the first project of the EPFL Machine Learining course. In this project, we aim at solving the Higgs Boson classification, a problem posed by the CERN.  

## Folders/files 
In the 'Scripts' folder are the following files: 
|'run.py'| A main script containing our best method chosen to solve this classification problem : Ridge Regression


|'implementations.py'| A file containing our implementation of 6 machine learning regression and classification algorithms 
 - least squares 
 - least squares Gradient Descent
 - least squares Stochastic Gradient Descent 
 - Ridge Regression
 - Logistic regression 
 - Regularized logistic regression
 
|'proj1_helpers'| A file containing all other additional necessary functions used for 
 - loading the data
 - preprocessing
 - splitting the data
 - cross validation
 - batch iteration 
 
## Requirements to run the project 
The following 'Python 3' packages are necessary for running our project :
'numpy'
'matplotlib'
